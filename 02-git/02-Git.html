# Git(Hub) solves this problem

### Git

- Git is a distributed version control system. (Wait, what?)
- Okay, try this: Imagine if Dropbox and the "Track changes" feature in MS Word had a baby. Git would be that baby.
- In fact, it's even better than that because Git is specifically optimised for the type of things that economists spend a lot of time working on (e.g. code).
- There is a learning curve, but I promise you that it's worth it.

### GitHub

- It's important to realise the Git and Github are distinct things.
- GitHub is an online hosting platform that provides an array of services built on top of the Git system. (Similar platforms include Bitbucket and GitLab.)
- Just like we don't *need* Rstudio to run R code, we don't *need* GitHub to use Git... But it will make our lives so much easier.

---

# Git(Hub) for scientific research

### From software development...

Git and GitHub's role in global software develoment is not in question.
- There's a high probability that your favourite app, program or package is built using Git-based tools. (RStudio is a case in point.)

### ... to scientific research

Scientists and academic researchers are cottoning on too. 
- Benefits of VC and collaboration tools aside, Git(Hub) helps to operationalise the ideals of open science and reproducibility.
- Journals have increasingly strict requirements regarding reproducibility and data access. GH makes this easy (DOI integration, off-the-shelf licences, etc.)
- I host all of the code and data for my [papers](http://grantmcdermott.com/research/) on GH. Same for teaching materials. I even use it to host and maintain my [website](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/grantmcdermott.github.io).
- **Read:** "[Democratic databases: science on GitHub](https://www.nature.com/news/democratic-databases-science-on-github-1.20719)" (*Nature*).

# Seemless integration

One of the (many) great features of RStudio is how well it integrates version control into your everyday workflow.
- Even though Git is a completely separate program to R, they feel like part of the same "thing" in RStudio.
- This next section is about learning the basic Git(Hub) commands and the recipe for successful project integration with RStudio.

--

I also want to bookmark this as a general point that we'll revisit many times during the course: 
- The tools that we're using all form part of a coherent data science ecosystem.
- Seemless integration greatly reduces the cognitive overhead ("aggregation") associated with traditional workflows, where you have juggle multiple programs and languages at the same time.

# Link a GitHub repo to an RStudio Project 

The starting point for our workflow is to link a GitHub repository (i.e. "repo") to an RStudio Project. Here are the steps:

1. Create the repo on GitHub and initialize with a README.
2. Copy the HTTPS/SSH link (the green "Clone or Download" button).&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
3. Open up RStudio.
4. Navigate to **File -&gt; New Project -&gt; Version Control -&gt; Git**.
5. Paste your copied link into the "Repository URL:" box.
6. Check that your new repo is located where you want it to be ("Create project as subdirectory of:") and click "OK".

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It's easiest to start with HTTPS, but &lt;a href="http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#ssh-keys" target="_blank"&gt;SSH&lt;/a&gt; is advised for more advanced users.]

---

# Why this setup?

Creating the repo on GitHub first means that it will always be "upstream" of your (and any other) local copies.
- In effect, this allows GitHub to act as the central node in the distributed VC network.
- Especially valuable when you are collaborating on a project with others — more on this later — but also has advantages when you are working alone.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

RStudio Projects are great. Again, they interact seemlessly with Git(Hub), as we've just seen. They also solve absolute vs. relative path problems, since the .Rproj file acts as an anchor point for all other files in the repo.
  - You know that calling files from `USERNAME/Documents/Special-Subfolder/etc` makes you a bad person, right?

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; If you would like to move an existing project to GitHub, my advice is still to create an empty repo there first, clone it locally, and then copy all your files across.]

---

# Practice

Practice by creating your own repo on GitHub and cloning it via an RStudio Project.
- Call it "testing" (or whatever you like).
- Remember to initialize with a README.

Pay attention to the top-right window panel in your RStudio IDE. 
- Do you see the "Git" tab? Click on it.

Open up the README (see the "Files" tab in the bottom-right window panel).
- Add some text like "Hello World!" and save the file.
- What has happened in the "Git" panel above?

Please raise your hand when you're done.

# Git commands from the shell

---

# Two steps forward, one step back?

The GitHub + RStudio Project combo is ideal for new users.
- RStudio's Git integration and built-in GUI cover all the the major operations.
- RStudio Projects FTW.

However, I want to go over Git &lt;a href="http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#shell" target="_blank"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt; commands so that you can internalise the basics.
- The shell is more powerful and flexible. Does things that the RStudio Git GUI can't.
- Not to mention more appropriate for projects that aren't primarily based in *R*.
- We'll also discuss options for standalone Git GUIs (e.g. GitKraken, SourceTree, Atom) towards the end of class.

--

Yes, we're going to cover the shell in depth next lecture, but think of this as a sneak preview.

---

# Main Git shell commands

Clone the repo.
```bash
$ git clone REPOSITORY-URL
```

See the commit history (hit spacebar to scroll down or q to exit).
```bash
$ git log
```

What has changed? 
```bash
$ git status
```
---

# Main Git shell commands (cont.)

Add (or "stage") a file or group of files.
```bash
$ git add NAME-OF-FILE-OR-FOLDER
```

There are a bunch of useful flag options here too:

- Stage updated files only (modified or deleted, but not new).
```bash
$ git add -u
```
- Stage new files only (not updated).
```bash
$ git add .
```

- Stage all files.
```bash
$ git add -A
```

---

# Main Git shell commands (cont.)

Commit your changes with a helpful message.
```bash
$ git commit -m "Added robustness check"
```

Pull from the upstream repository (i.e. GitHub).
```bash
$ git pull
```

Push any local changes that you've commited to the upstream repo (i.e. GitHub).
```bash
$ git push
```

---

# Git recipe book

1. Add (stage) and commit any local changes
```bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Amazing new code"
```

2. Pull any changes from the upstream repo
```bash
$ git pull
```

3. (Fix any merge conflicts)

4. Push your local changes to the GitHub repo
```bash
$ git push
```

--
You can switch 1 and 2. The NB thing is to &lt;i&gt;**always pull from the upstream repo before you push any changes**&lt;/i&gt;. Seriously, do this even on solo projects. Making it a habit will save you headaches down the road.

# Collaboration time 

Turn to the person next to you. You are now partners. (Congratulations.)

- Partner 1: Invite Partner 2 to join you as a collaborator on the "testing" GitHub repo that you created earlier. (See "Settings".)

- Partner 2: Clone the repo to your local machine. Make some edits to the README. Push these changes.

- Partner 1: Make changes to the README on your machine too. Stage, commit and then try to push them (*after* pulling from the GitHub repo first!).

--

Did you (i.e. Partner 1) encounter a `merge conflict` error? 
- Good, that's what we were trying to trigger.
- Now, let's learn how to fix them.

---

# Merge conflicts

Let's confirm what's going on.
```bash
$ git status
```

As part of the response, you should see something like:
```bash
Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to mark resolution)

   * both modified:   README.md 
```
- Git is protecting Partner 1 by refusing the merge. It wants to make sure that you don't accidentally overwrite all of your changes by pulling Partner 2's version of the README.

--

PS — In this case, the source of the problem was obvious. Once we start working on bigger projects, however, `git status` can provide a helpful summary to see which files are in conflict.

---

# Merge conflicts (cont.)

Okay, let's see what's happening by opening up the README file.
- RStudio is a good choice, although your preferred text editor is fine.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

You should see something like:
```bash
# README
Some text here.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
Text added by Partner 2.
=======
Text added by Partner 1.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 814e09178910383c128045ce67a58c9c1df3f558.
More text here.
```

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I also use and recommend &lt;a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;. You can set your preferred default editor with `$ git config --global core.editor "PREFERRED_EDITOR"`.]

- `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;` Indicates the end of the lines that had a merge conflict.

---

# Merge conflicts (cont.)

Fixing these conflicts is a simple matter of (manually) editing the README file.
- Delete the lines of the text that you don't want.
- Delete the special Git merge conflict symbols.

Once that's done, you should be able to stage, commit, pull and finally push your changes to the GitHub repo without any errors.

--

Caveats
- Partner 1 gets to decide what to keep because they fixed the merge conflict.
- OTOH, the full commit history is preserved, so Partner 2 can always recover their changes if desired.
- A more elegant and democratic solution to merge conflicts (and repo changes in general) is provided by Git **branches**. We'll get there next.

# Aside: Line endings and different OSs

### Problem

During your collaboration, you may have encountered a situation where Git is highlighting differences on seemingly unchanged sentences.
- If that is the case, check whether your partner is using a different OS to you.

The "culprit" is the fact that Git adds an invisible character at the end of every line. This is how Git tracks changes. (More info [here](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/).)
- For Linux and MacOS, that ending is "LF"
- For Windows, that ending is "CRLF" (of course it is...)

### Solution

Open up the shell and enter

```bash
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

(Windows users: Change `input` to `true`).

---

# Why use branches

Branches are one of the coolest features of Git(Hub).
- Allow you to take a snapshot of your existing repo and try out a whole new idea *without affecting your main branch*.
- Only once you (and your collaborators) are satisfied would you merge it back into the main branch.
  - This is how most new features in modern software and apps are developed.
  - It is also how bugs are identified and fixed.
  - But researchers can easily -- and should! -- use it to try out new ideas and analysis (e.g. robustness checks, revisions, etc.)
- If you aren't happy, then you can just delete the branch and continue as if nothing happened.

---

# How to branch

Create a new branch on your local machine and switch to it:
```bash
$ git checkout -b NAME-OF-YOUR-NEW-BRANCH
```

Push the new branch to GitHub:
```bash
$ git push origin NAME-OF-YOUR-NEW-BRANCH
```

List all branches on your local machine:
```bash
$ git branch
```

Switch back to (e.g.) the master branch:
```bash
$ git checkout master
```

Delete a branch
```bash
$ git branch -d NAME-OF-YOUR-FAILED-BRANCH
$ git push origin :NAME-OF-YOUR-FAILED-BRANCH
```

---

# Merging branches and pull requests

You have two options:

### 1. Locally
- Commit your final changes to the branch (let's call it "feature").
- Switch back to the master branch: `$ git checkout master`
- Merge in the branch changes: `$ git merge feature`
- Delete the feature branch (optional): `$ git branch -d feature`
  
### 2. Remotely (i.e. *pull requests* on GitHub)
- PRs are a way to notify collaborators — or yourself! — that you have completed a feature.
- You write a summary of all the changes contained in the branch.
- You then assign suggested reviewers of your code — often yourself — who are then able to approve these changes ("Merge pull request") on GitHub.
- Let's practice this in class: See &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for instructions.

# README

README files are special in GitHub because they act as repo landing pages.
- For a project tied to a research paper, this is where you should be explicit about the goal of the research paper, the software requirements, how to run the analysis, and so forth (e.g. [here](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/bycatch)).
- On the other end of the scale, many GitHub repos are basically standalone README files. Think of these as version-controlled blog posts (e.g. [here](https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-teachers)). 

README files can also be added to the *sub-directories* of a repo, where they will act as a landing pages too.
- Particularly useful for bigger projects. Say, where you are using multiple programming languages (e.g. [here](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/blueparadox/tree/master/R)), or want to add more detail about a dataset (e.g. [here](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/sceptic-priors/tree/master/Data)).

READMEs should be written in Markdown, which GH automatically renders.
- We'll learn more about [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (and its close relation, [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)) during the course of our homework assignments.

---

# .gitgnore

A .gitignore file tells Git what to — *wait for it* — ignore.

This is especially useful if you want to exclude whole folders or a class of files (e.g. based on size or type).
- Proprietary data files should be ignored from the beginning if you intend to make a repo public at some point.
- Very large individual files (&gt;100 MB) exceed GitHub's maxmimum allowable size and should be ignored regardless. See &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-large-files/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/versioning-large-files/" target=_"blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

I typically add compiled datasets to my .gitignore in the early stages of a project.
- Reduces redundant version control history, where the main thing is the code that produces the compiled dataset, not the end CSV in of itself. ("Source is real.")
- Simple to remove from my .gitignore once the project is being finalised (e.g. paper is being submitted).
  
---

# .gitgnore (cont.)

You can create a .gitignore file in multiple ways.

- A .gitignore file was automatically generated if you cloned your repo with an RStudio Project.
- You could also have the option of adding one when you first create a repo on GitHub.
- Or, you can create one with your preferred text editor. (Must be saved as ".gitignore".)

Once the .gitignore file is created, simply add in lines of text corresponding to the files that should be ignored.

- To ignore a single a file: `FILE-I-WANT-TO-IGNORE.csv`
- To ignore a whole folder (and all of its contents, subfolders, etc.): `FOLDER-NAME/**`
- The standard shell commands and special characters apply.
  - E.g. Ignore all CSV files in the repo: `*.csv`
  - E.g. Ignore all files beginning with "test": `test*`

# Recipe (shell commands in grey)

1. Create a repo on GitHub and initiaize with a README.

2. Clone the repo to your local machine. Preferably using an RStudio Project, but as you wish. (E.g. Shell command: `$ git clone REPOSITORY-URL`)

3. Stage any changes you make: `$ git add -A`

4. Commit your changes: `$ git commit -m "Helpful message"`

5. Pull from GitHub: `$ git pull`

6. (Fix any merge conflicts.)

7. Push your changes to GitHub: `$ git push`

--

Repeat steps 3—7 (but especially steps 3 and 4) often.

# FAQ

**Q: When should I commit (and push) changes?**

**A: Early and often.**
- It's not quite as important as saving your work regularly, but it's a close second.
- You should certainly push everything that you want your collaborators to see.
  
**Q: Do I need branches if I am working on a solo project?**

**A: You don't *need* them, but they offer big advantages in maintaining a sane workflow.**
- Experiment without any risk to the main project!
- If you combine them with pull requests, then you can compress significant additions to your project (which may comprise many small edits) into a single branch.

---

# FAQ (cont.)

**Q: What's the difference between cloning and forking a repo?**

**A: Cloning directly ties your local version to the original repo, while forking creates a copy on your GitHub (which you can then clone).**
- &lt;a href="http://happygitwithr.com/clone.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cloning&lt;/a&gt; makes it easier to fetch updates (and is often the best choice for new GitHub users), but &lt;a href="http://happygitwithr.com/fork.html" target="_blank"&gt;forking&lt;/a&gt; has advantages too.

**Q: What happens when something goes wrong?**

**A: Think: "Oh shit, Git!"**
- Seriously: http://ohshitgit.com/.
  
**Q: What happens when something goes &lt;i&gt;horribly&lt;/i&gt; wrong?**

**A: Burn it down and start again.**
- http://happygitwithr.com/burn.html
- This is a great advantage of Git's distributed nature. If something goes horribly wrong, there's usually an intact version somewhere else.
