# The UNIX philosophy

> **Do One Thing And Do It Well.** 

The DOTADIW ideal can be applied across the computing spectrum: commands, functions, programs, etc.
- By pairing and chaining well-designed individual components, we can build powerful and much more complex larger systems.
- You can see why the UNIX philosophy is also referred to as "minimalist and modular".
  
This philosphy is very clearly expressed in the design of the UNIX shell, its various forms, and its commands.

---

# Definitions

The "shell", "terminal", "command prompt"... are all basically<sup>1</sup> different names for the same thing.
- They are all referring to a *command line interface* (CLI).
  
There are many variants of the shell — even within UNIX — but we're going to work with [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (**B**ourne **A**gain **SH**ell).
- Default shell on Linux and MacOS.
- Windows users can install it via Git for Windows ([here](https://gitforwindows.org/)), or the new Windows Subsystem for Linux ([here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target)).


.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> [Truth be told](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4126/what-is-the-exact-difference-between-a-terminal-a-shell-a-tty-and-a-con), there are some subtle and rather important differences, as well as some pretty interesting history behind them. But we'll abstract from these differences here.
]

--

FWIW, I primarily use the zsh shell in my day-to-day work (with some custom theming), which is why it might look somewhat different to yours during live coding sessions. 

---

# Why bother with the shell?

1. Power
  - Both for executing commands and for fixing problems.
2. Reproducibility
 - Scripting is reproducible, while clicking is not.
3. Interacting with servers and super computers
  - The shell is often the only game in town for high performance computing. We'll cover this in more depth in a later lecture.
4. Automating workflow and analysis pipelines
  - Easily tracking and reproducing an entire project (combining multiple programs, scripts, etc.).

--

- We're going to focus on 1, 2 and 3 in this course. That's not to say that 4 is unimportant (<a href="http://stat545.com/automation00_index.html" target="_blank">far from it</a>), but we won't have time to cover it here.

# Useful keyboard shortcuts

- `Tab` completion.

- Use the `↑` (and `↓`) keys to scroll through previous commands.

- `Ctrl`+`→` (and `Ctrl`+`←`) to skip whole words at a time.

- `Ctrl`+`a` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.

- `Ctrl`+`e` moves the cursor to the end of the line.

- `Ctrl`+`k` deletes everything to the right of the cursor.

- `Ctrl`+`u` deletes everything to the left of the cursor.

- `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`c` to copy and `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`v` to paste.

- `clear` to clear your terminal.

- You don't always need options or arguments. (E.g. `$ ls ~/Documents/` and `$ ls -lh` are both valid commands that will yield output.)

- However, you always need a **command**.

---

# Syntax (cont.)

**options**
- Start with a dash.
- Usually one letter.
- Multiple options can be chained together under a single dash.
  ```bash
  $ ls -l -a -h /var/log
  $ ls -lah /var/log
  ```
- An exception is with (rarer) options requiring two dashes.
  ```bash
  $ ls --group-directories-first --human-readable /var/log
  ```

**arguments**
- Tell the command *what* to operate on.
- Usually a file, path, or a set of files and folders.

---

# Help

The `man` command ("manual pages") is your friend if you ever need help.

```bash
$ man ls
```
- Hit "h" to see the help notes of the `man` command itself (e.g. you'll see that the spacebar causes you to move down one window) and "q" to quit.

--

I also like the `cheat` utility, which provides a readable summary / cheatsheet for a command. You'll need to <a href="https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat" target="_blank">install</a> it first. (Not available to Windows users.)
```bash
$ cheat ls
```

# Files, folders and permissions

---

# Navigation

- `pwd` prints (the current) working directory.

- `cd` lets you change directory.
  - You can use absolute paths, but it's better to use relative paths and invoke special symbols for a user's home folder (`~`), current directory (`.`), and parent directory (`..`) as needed. 
  ```bash
  $ cd ~/Documents/Papers
  $ cd ../.. # Goes up two folders (BTW, hashes define comments in Bash shell.)
  ```
---

# Navigation (cont.)

Beware of folder names that contain spaces. 

- Simply writing, say, `$ cd My Documents` won't work. (Why?)

--

  - Small brain: Use quotation marks: `$ cd "My Documents"`.

  - Big brain: Use Tab completion to automatically "escape" the space: `$ cd My\ Documents`. 
  
  - Galaxy brain: Don't use spaces in file and folder names.

# Listing files and their properties

- We're about to go into more depth about the `ls` command.

- To do this effectively, it will be helpful if we're all working off the same group of files and folders.

- Clone <a href="https://github.com/scottsimpson/commandlinebasics" target="_blank">this repo</a> to your home folder, navigate to the "Excercise Files" subfolder, and list the files with the `-l` option ("long format").

```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/scottsimpson/commandlinebasics.git
$ cd commandlinebasics/Exercise\ Files/ # Remember to escape the space!
$ ls -lh
total 138K

# The super user: "root" and `sudo`

There are two main user roles on a linux system:   
1. Normal users 
2. A super user (AKA "root")

Difference is one of priviledge. 
- Super users can make system changes, install software, browse through different users' home folders, etc. Normal users are much more restricted in what they can do.
- Explains why Unix-based OS's are much more resilient to security threats like viruses. Need super user priviledges to install (malicious) software.

To log in the super user, you need to know (or [set](http://mixeduperic.com/ubuntu/how-to-set-the-root-password-in-ubuntu.html)) root's password. 
- Note the extra visual cue: Root's command prompt is a `#` (not a `$`).
  ```bash
  root@laptop:~#
  ```

---

# The super user: "root" and `sudo` (cont.)

It's generally considered very poor practice to log in as root.
- You needlessly risk messing up your system. Remember there's no "undo" option when working through the shell.

How, then, can normal users perform meaningful system operations (including installing new programs and updating software)?

--

**Answer:** Invoke temporary super user status with <span style="font-family:Fira Code; font-size:80%; color: #333; background: #f8f8f8; padding: 0.225em;";>
<span style='background: #ffff88;'>sudo</span></span>. 
--

- Stands for "super user do".
- Simply prepend `sudo` to whatever command you want to run.

```bash
grant@laptop:~$ apt install libxml2-dev ## fails
grant@laptop:~$ sudo apt install libxml2-dev ## works
```

???

You have to be a "permitted" user to invoke `sudo`. This should be enabled by default on your personal laptop, but if not see [here](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/sudo-command-examples/embed/) or [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-sudo-user-on-ubuntu-quickstart).
