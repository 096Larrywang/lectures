# Checklist

☑ Have you cloned the course lecture repo to your local machine?

☑ Once that's done, pull to get the latest lecture slides.


Recommended: Spruce up your GitHub profiles. 
- Add your full name, a profile picture, link to website, etc.
- No-one wants to work with (or hire) a barcode.

--

&lt;/br&gt;

Today's lecture is the last detour before we get back to data analyis with R and RStudio.
- Laying proper foundations with Git and the shell will put us in a strong positon for advanced data science work as the course develops.

# The Unix philosophy

The shell tools that we're going to be using today have their roots in the [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) family of operating systems originally developed at Bells Labs in the 1970s.

Besides paying homage, acknowledging the Unix lineage is important because these tools still embody the "[Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)":

&gt; **Do One Thing And Do It Well** 

--

The DOTADIW ideal can be applied across the computing spectrum: commands, functions, programs, etc.
- By pairing and chaining well-designed individual components, we can build powerful and much more complex larger systems.
- You can see why the Unix philosophy is also referred to as "minimalist and modular".
  
Again, this philosophy is very clearly expressed in the design and functionality of the Unix shell.

---

# Definitions

Don't be thrown off by terminology: The "shell", "terminal", "tty", "command prompt", etc. 
- These are all basically&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; just different names for the same thing.
- They are all referring to a *command line interface* (CLI).
  
There are many shell variants&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but we're going to focus on [**Bash**](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (i.e. **B**ourne **a**gain **sh**ell).
- Default shell on Linux and MacOS.
- Windows users should have installed it via Git for Windows ([here](https://gitforwindows.org/)), or the new Windows Subsystem for Linux ([here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target)).


.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; [Truth be told](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4126/what-is-the-exact-difference-between-a-terminal-a-shell-a-tty-and-a-con), there are some subtle and sometimes important differences, as well as some interesting history behind the names. But we can safely ignore these here.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; For the record, I primarily use the Z shell (zsh) in my day-to-day work, which is why it might look [somewhat different](https://ohmyz.sh/) to yours during live coding sessions.

# Why bother with the shell?

1. Power
  - Both for executing commands and for fixing problems. There are some things you just can't do in an IDE or GUI.
  - It also avoids memory complications associated with certain applications and/or IDEs. We'll get to this issue later in the course.
2. Reproducibility
 - Scripting is reproducible, while clicking is not.
3. Interacting with servers and super computers
  - The shell is often the only game in town for high performance computing. We'll get to this later in the course.
4. Automating workflow and analysis pipelines
  - Easily track and reproduce an entire project (e.g. use a Makefile to combine multiple programs, scripts, etc.)

--

We're going to focus on 1, 2 and 3 in this course. That's not to say that 4 is unimportant (far from it), but we just won't have time to cover it. 
- [Here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/notes/cm109.nb.html), [here](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/index.html), and [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) are great places to learn about automation on your own if you're interested.

# Bash shell basics
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

---

# First look

Open up your Bash shell. 
- [Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu) (You already know what you're doing, but still...)
- [Mac](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-open-terminal-on-a-macbook)
- [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/)

You can also access the Bash shell through RStudio, by clicking on the "Terminal" tab of the bottom-left window pane (i.e. next to the "Console" tab).
- This should run Bash by default if it is installed on your system. See [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal) for more details.

---

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username@hostname:~$
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"
  &lt;!-- - Type in `$ whoami` without the leading dollar sign to confirm. --&gt;

---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 `username`@hostname:~$ 
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 


---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username`@hostname`:~$ 
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username@hostname`:~`$ 
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

- `:~` denotes the directory path (where `~` signifies the user's home directory).


---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username@hostname:~`$`
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

- `:~` denotes the directory path (where `~` signifies the user's home directory).

- `$` denotes the start of the command prompt.
  - We'll get to this later, but for a special "superuser" called root, the dollar sign will change to a `#`.

---

# Useful keyboard shortcuts

- `Tab` completion.

- Use the `↑` (and `↓`) keys to scroll through previous commands.

- `Ctrl`+`→` (and `Ctrl`+`←`) to skip whole words at a time.

- `Ctrl`+`a` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.

- `Ctrl`+`e` moves the cursor to the end of the line.

- `Ctrl`+`k` deletes everything to the right of the cursor.

- `Ctrl`+`u` deletes everything to the left of the cursor.

- `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`c` to copy and `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`v` to paste.

- `clear` to clear your terminal.

# Syntax

All shell commands have the same basic syntax:

**&lt;center&gt;command option(s) argument(s)&lt;/center&gt;**

Examples:

  ```bash
  $ ls -lh ~/Documents/
  ```
  ```bash
  $ sort -u myfile.txt
  ```

---
count: false

# Syntax

All shell commands have the same basic syntax:

**&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style='background: #ffff88;'&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; option(s) argument(s)&lt;/center&gt;**

Examples:

  ```bash
  $ `ls` -lh ~/Documents/
  ```
  ```bash
  $ `sort` -u myfile.txt
  ```

# Syntax

All shell commands have the same basic syntax:

**&lt;center&gt;command option(s) &lt;span style='background: #ffff88;'&gt;argument(s)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;**

Examples:

  ```bash
  $ ls -lh `~/Documents/`
  ```
  ```bash
  $ sort -u `myfile.txt`
  ```

--

&lt;/br&gt;

**commands**
- You don't always need options or arguments. (E.g. `$ ls ~/Documents/` and `$ ls -lh` are both valid commands that will yield output.)
- However, you always need a command.

---

# Syntax (cont.)

**options**
- Start with a dash.
- Usually one letter.
- Multiple options can be chained together under a single dash.
  ```bash
  $ ls -l -a -h /var/log
  $ ls -lah /var/log
  ```
- An exception is with (rarer) options requiring two dashes.
  ```bash
  $ ls --group-directories-first --human-readable /var/log
  ```

**arguments**
- Tell the command *what* to operate on.
- Usually a file, path, or a set of files and folders.

---

# Help

The `man` command ("manual pages") is your friend if you ever need help.

```bash
$ man ls
```
- Hit "h" to see the help notes of the `man` command itself (e.g. you'll see that the spacebar causes you to move down one window) and "q" to quit.

--

I also like the `cheat` utility, which provides a readable summary / cheatsheet for a command. You'll need to [install](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat) it first. (Linux and MacOS only.)
```bash
$ cheat ls
```

---

# Navigation

- `pwd` prints (the current) working directory.

- `cd` lets you change directory.
  - You can use absolute paths, but it's better to use relative paths and invoke special symbols for a user's home folder (`~`), current directory (`.`), and parent directory (`..`) as needed. 
  ```bash
  $ cd ~/Documents/Papers
  $ cd ../.. # Goes up two folders (BTW, hashes define comments in Bash shell.)
  ```
---

# Navigation (cont.)

Beware of folder names that contain spaces. 

- Why won't `$ cd My Documents` work?

--

**Answer:** Bash syntax is unapologetically strict about spaces and ordering. Here it thinks that "My" and "Documents" are separate arguments.

--

  - Small brain: Use quotation marks: `$ cd "My Documents"`.

  - Big brain: Use Tab completion to automatically "escape" the space: `$ cd My\ Documents`. 
  
  - Galaxy brain: Don't use spaces in file and folder names.

# Listing files and their properties

We're about to go into more depth about the `ls` command.
- To do this effectively, it will be helpful if we're all working off the same group of files and folders.
- Navigate to the "exercises" subfolder of this lecture folder and list the files with the `-lh` option ("long format", "human readable").

```bash
$ cd examples ## Assumes you are starting off in the "03-shell" lecture folder
$ ls -lh
total 136K
drwxr-xr-x 2 grant users 4.0K Jan 12 22:02  ABC

*Disclaimer: This next section is tailored towards Unix-based operating systems (Linux or MacOS). However, it will become relevant to everyone (even Windows users) once we start interacting with Linux servers, spinning up Docker containers, etc. later in the course.*

---

# The superuser: root, sudo, etc.

There are two main user roles on a Linux system:   
1. Normal users 
2. A superuser (AKA "root")

Difference is one of priviledge. 
- Superusers can make system changes, install software, browse through different users' home folders, etc. Normal users are much more restricted in what they can do.
- Explains why Unix-based OS's are much more resilient to security threats like viruses. Need superuser priviledges to install (potentially malicious) software.

--

To fully switch over to the superuser, you can type `sudo -s`. 
- Remember to type `exit` to switch back!
- Note the extra visual cue: root's command prompt is a `#` (not a `$`).
  ```bash
  root@laptop:~#
  ```

However...

---

# The superuser: root, sudo, etc. (cont.)

It is generally considered very poor practice to switch over to root for long periods, since you needlessly risk messing up your system. 
- Remember there's no "undo" option when working through the shell.

--

**Question:** How, then, can normal users perform meaningful system operations (including installing new programs and updating software)?

--

**Answer:** Invoke temporary superuser status with `sudo`.

- Stands for "superuser do".
- Simply prepend `sudo` to whatever command you want to run.

```bash
grant@laptop:~$ ls /root ## fails
grant@laptop:~$ sudo ls /root ## works
```

--

&lt;/br&gt;

*Note: You have to be a "permitted" user to invoke `sudo`. This should be enabled by default on your personal laptop, but if not see [here](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/sudo-command-examples/embed/) or [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-sudo-user-on-ubuntu-quickstart).*

---

# Changing permissions and ownership

Let's go back to the folder that we saw previously.

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 grant users 4.0K Jan 12 22:12  ABC
```

We can change the permissions and ownership of this folder with the `chmod` and `chown` commands, respectively.
- We'll review these in turn.
- Note that I'm going to use the "recursive" option (i.e. `-R`), but only because ABC is a folder. You can drop that when modifying individual files.


---

# chmod

Changing permissions using `chmod` depends on how those permissions are represented. 
- There are two options: 1) Octal notation and 2) Symbolic notation. 
- We'll go into more detail on the next slide, but let's see some examples first.
- (Test the results yourself using `$ ls -lh ABC` afterwards.)

**Example 1: rwxrwxrwx.** Read, write and execute permission for all users.
- Octal: `$ chmod -R 777 ABC`
- Symbolic: `$ chmod -R a=rwx ABC`

**Example 2: rwxr-xr-x.** Read, write and execute permission for the main user (i.e. owner) of the file. For all other users, read and execute permission only.
- Octal: `$ chmod -R 755 ABC`
- Symbolic: `$ chmod -R u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx ABC`

--

Now that we've seen some examples, let's get into the logic behind them.

---

# chmod (cont.)

### Octal notation

Takes advantage of the fact that `4` (for "read"), `2` (for "write"), and `1` (for "execute") can be combined in unambiguous ways.
- 7 (= 4 + 2 + 1) means read, write and execute permission.
- 5 (= 4 + 0 + 1) means read and execute permission, but not write permission.
- etc. 
- Note that Octal notation requires a number for each of the three user types: owner, owner's group, and all others. E.g. `chmod 777 myfile.txt`

### Symbolic notation

Links permissions to different symbols (i.e. abbreviations).
- Users: `u` ("User/owner"), `g` ("Group"), `o` ("Others""), `a` ("All")
- Permissions: `r` ("read"), `w` ("write"), `x` ("execute")
- Changes: `+` ("add permissions"), `-` ("remove permissions"), `=` ("set new permissions") 

---

# chmod (cont.)

Here's a quick comparison table with some common permission levels.

| Octal value | Symbolic value    | Permission level |
|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| 777         | a+rwx             | rwxrwxrwx        |
| 770         | u+rwx,g+rwx,o-rwx | rwx------        |
| 755         | a+rwx,g=rw,o=rw   | rwxrwxrwx        |
| 700         | u+rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx | rwx------        |
| 644         | u=rw,g=r,o=r      | rw-r--r--        |


--

Note that changing permissions via the Symbolic method doesn't need the whole entry. E.g. To go from the first line to the second, I'd only need `$ chmod o-rwx myfile`
