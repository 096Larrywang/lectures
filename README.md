# Lecture notes for "Environmental Economics and Data Science"

This a PhD seminar taught by [Grant McDermott](http://grantmcdermott.com) at the University of Oregon's Economics Department. 

Please read the [syllabus](https://github.com/uo-ec607/syllabus/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) before you go through any of the lectures, to get a better sense of the aims and scope of the course. I also have some minor requests (in the "FAQ" section right at the end) if you are interested in adapting the material here for your own course.
